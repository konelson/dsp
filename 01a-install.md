# Install software on your computer


### Install [git](http://git-scm.com/).

You have it installed if you can run `git --version` at the command
line and get output like `git version 2.13.5`.

Macbooks have git pre-installed.


### Install [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads).

Please install the **3.6 version** if possible.

There are two things you can verify to check your install.

First, from the command line, all of the following should start up
some kind of Python interpreter:

```bash
python3
ipython3
jupyter notebook
spyder
```

Second, inside any of those Python interpreters, you should be able to
do all of these without error:

```python
import numpy
import scipy
import matplotlib
import pandas
import statsmodels
import sklearn
```

### Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) on Mac _(optional)_

For users who are already familiar with package managers, you may prefer to install Homebrew.

However, this is completely optional as Anaconda is an all-in-one package manager.

### Q1. Python Version 2 or 3

**Course material for the bootcamp is compatible with Python versions 2.7 and 3.0. All HackerRank Python pre-work is configured for Python 3 only.  Therefore, Python 3 is the recommended version.**  

Did you install Python 2 or 3? Why?  

>> I have had both Python 2 and Python 3 already installed on my computer and have used both versions while learning Python, as I switched between study materials.  I have been working primarily in Python 2 but will continue in Python 3, as recommended.

### Q2. Which Python Version Installed   

In the Terminal:

`python3 --version`

>> Python 2 | Python 3
>>----------|----------
>>2.7.14|3.6.1

From the command line in Windows python --version shows I have Python 2.7.14 installed on my computer.  'Python 2' and 'Python 3', do not yield any response, nor do the commands above.  I can only access Python 3 via Jupyter Notebook. I am currently working off Windows 10 but will be moving over to a Mac this weekend.  I will go through this exercise on my second computer, however, I would still like to resolve this issue.
